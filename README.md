# Project Yes Show
***

This project involves the analysis of hospital patients information from certain areas in Brazil concerning appointments scheduling times and the actual appointment days, patient ages, chronic illnesses and the turn up rate of patients. Of particular interest is the use of SMS reminders for appointments to enamble better hospital turn out.


### Dependencies
***

The best way to get the libraries needed for this analysis is through the installation of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) which gives a comprehensive Python package and its range of libraries that enabled this project to be done. The project was run in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). The libraries used in this project are:

1. Python 3
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib

### Summary
***

The use of mobile technology has been helpful in health care. It's correct implementation can increase the patient care and specialization available, as well as ease the burden on health personnel. In this study, an SMS reminder was sent to patients to remind them of their scheduled appointment.

The dataset gave some intesting findings, but focus lay in only three aspects: the gender of patients, the neighbourhood with the highest turn out of patients, and the effect of receiving an SMS reminder on the patients.

For starters, there were more females than males who went to the hospital. They were also the most likely to show up for an appointment, too. And not just because they were the largest number of people who went to the hospital when they were scheduled to. 

Then the hospital neighbourhood with the most patients was Jardim Camburi. They had 7, 717 visits in a period of 211 days, and 509 hypertensive patients.

Analysis of the show up afer receiving a message indicates that sending SMS reminders did not make a difference to the patients. Out of all patients, less than a half of them showed up after receiving an SMS reminder. It was intereseting to note that out of all patients, those who did not receive a message made up to 70% of patients who showed up for their appointment.

### Limitations
***

The dataset did not have representation for the population who did not identify as male or female. Also, the analysis was only focused on its areas of interest and none else.
